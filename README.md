# River Garbage Detection Robot
Overview
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for detecting garbage in rivers using computer vision. The robot is equipped with a camera and sensors to identify and collect waste from the river, helping to maintain a cleaner environment. The detection system utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, particularly focusing on deep learning and image processing to accurately identify various types of garbage.

Features
Robot Description: The robot is designed to navigate through rivers autonomously. It is equipped with a high-resolution camera, GPS for navigation, and sensors to avoid obstacles. The robot collects images and sends them to a central system for analysis.

Machine Learning Techniques: The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and object detection. These techniques allow the system to learn and recognize different types of garbage from a large dataset of river images.

Model Training: The training process involves collecting a large dataset of images containing various types of garbage and non-garbage items. These images are labeled and used to train the CNN model. The training process is iterative, involving multiple epochs and adjustments to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.

Data Processing: Images are preprocessed before being fed into the model. This preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to enhance the model's robustness.

Computer Vision: The computer vision system processes the images captured by the robot's camera in real-time. It detects and classifies garbage, allowing the robot to take appropriate actions to collect and dispose of the waste.
